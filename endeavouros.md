## ENDEAVOUROS

<b><i>WHY?</i></b>
<p>
After using both Ubuntu 22.02 (Jammy Jellyfish) and GNOME Arch Linux after some years, I ended up liking both operating systems. They both have features that I enjoy, especially about Arch being so lightweight on hardware resources (sometimes, but for the most part compared to Ubuntu). I decided to go with the GNOME version of <b>EndeavourOS</b> (https://endeavouros.com) as the main operating system for my computer as it looks very nice aesthetically in my personal opinion. The instructions & screenshots in the following installation steps may not be currently accurate, but represent the general process of setting up the operating system.
